    <p>Kasaragod ( Malayalam : കാസർഗോഡ് Kāsargōḍ [ ˈkaːsərɡoːɖ ]; also: Kasargod, Kasargode ) is a city in the southern Indian state of Kerala with about 54,000 inhabitants (2011 census). [2] It is located on the Malabar Coast in northern Kerala, not far from the border with the neighboring state of Karnataka , at the mouth of the Chandragiri (Payaswini) river in the Arabian Sea . The nearest major cities are Mangaluru (Mangalore) 50 kilometers north and Kozhikode(Calicut) 185 kilometers south. Kasaragod is the administrative seat of Kasaragod District .

      Kasaragod was early an important port and a center of overseas trade with Arabia . In the 14th century, the city came under the rule of the Vijayanagar Empire. After its decline in the 16th century, the Nayaks of Ikkeri took control of the coastal area. Chandragiri Fort was built on the other bank of the Chandagiri River in the 17th century during the Nayak period. At the end of the 18th century, Tippu Sultan , the ruler of Mysore , conquered Kasaragod. After Tipu Sultan's defeat by the British , the city passed to British India in 1799 and became known as the South Kanara District(Dakshina Kannada) incorporated into the Madras Presidency . After Indian independence in 1947, the states were reorganized according to language boundaries in 1956 by the States Reorganization Act . Because of its predominantly Malayalam-speaking population, Kasaragod was detached from the district of Dakshina Kannada and added to the district of Kannur in the newly established state of Kerala. In 1984 the city became the administrative seat of Kasaragod District.
      
      Kasaragod is a fairly heavily Muslim city. In the Thalangara district is the Malik Dinar Mosque, built in traditional Kerala architectural style and said to have been founded by Malik Ibn Dinar , who is said to have brought Islam to Kerala in the 7th century. The mosque houses the tomb of Malik Ibn Mohammed, a descendant of Malik Ibn Dinar. Also in Kasaragod is the Hindu Mallikarjuna Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva .</p>
